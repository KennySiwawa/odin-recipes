        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p> <strong> Gango </strong> is a traditional Zimbabwean dish that involves grilling a mixture 
                of meats (beef, pork, chicken, liver, gizzards and sausages) and sometimes vegetables 
                    in a large frying pan or over a fire. It's often enjoyed as a social meal 
                        with friends and family. The word <em>"Gango"</em> reflects the idea of mixing and 
                            bringing people together.
        </p>
        <p> The <em>Gango</em> dish, as prepared in <em>Zimbabwe,</em> is primarily a local specialty, but similar styles of 
            communal meat dishes are also enjoyed in neighboring countries like <em>South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Zambia. </em>
